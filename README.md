Project Sif
=================

An entirely open source discord bot for your entertainment and moderation purposes.

**Project Sif** is edited every week, with at least one to two commands added in that time.
I test all of my commands thoroughly before uploading them to the main bot itself. The
bot is hosted on a public server, and is open to the public. Anyone can view my code and
suggest edits, report bugs, or suggest additional commands on the Github page.

***Bot Functions Explained***

\-The bot gives you 0.25 "dollars" per message by default, your balance can be checked with `?coins`\
\-Multipliers can be bought with `?multiplier add`. Each multiplier costs 1000 times your current multiplier level, and each purchase doubles your multiplier.\
\-Buying multipliers can increase your dollars per message exponentially... my multiplier
is currently x36028797018963970, and I have 1486187877032263700 dollars. The more you upgrade
your multiplier, the harder it gets to upgrade again. However, I now have much more than what I need
to buy as many memes as I want, and to play as many rounds of roulette as I need :D\
\-Using the roulette, meme, and multiplier commands wisely will get you a lot of dollars.
